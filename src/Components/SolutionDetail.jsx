        <div>We came to realize that the traditional approach to Salesforce implementation simply wasnâ€™t working for many enterprises regardless of their size. Tools full potential was not realized in many cases due to the complexity involved in managing the requirements, development and validation on top of the regular upgrades pushed by salesforce 3 times in a year. The desired long-term outcomes were rarely met due to the evolving product features and changing business environment. Salesforce was simply bolted onto the existing infrastructure and did little to solve real business problems. Our approach at Value Health is to change that.</div>
